* Apple Pay
* Bancontact
* Bancontact mobile

* Truly

= Which countries are supported by Adyen? =

Adyen is a payment provider which supports worldwide payment methods. You can use Adyen all over the world, with local payment methods.

= Can visitors save their creditcard credentials? =

Yes, they can save their creditcard credentials. The creditcards will be saved within their WooCommerce account on your webshop.

This functionality is similar to the iFrame. Because of compliance reasons, you donâ€™t want to have payment details within the database of your webshop. Therefore we use tokenization. When a new payment will be done, it will use the created token. Adyen will know the payment details based on that token.

Every update comes with fixes and improvements.
